# Lucid CMS Monorepo Licensing

This repository is a monorepo that contains multiple packages, each potentially governed by its own software license. Below is a summary of the licensing model applied across the repository.

---

## üì¶ Core Packages (BSL 1.1)

The following packages are licensed under the **Business Source License 1.1 (BSL 1.1)**:

- [`@lucidcms/core`](packages/core)
- [`@lucidcms/admin`](packages/admin)

Each of these packages includes its own `LICENSE` file with the full BSL 1.1 license text and relevant Change Dates.

**Usage Note:**  
BSL 1.1 allows non-production and limited use under specific conditions. After a fixed time period (4 years), the license transitions to the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

The following packages are licensed under the **MIT License**, a permissive open source license:

- `@lucidcms/plugin-s3`
- `@lucidcms/plugin-local-storage`
- `@lucidcms/plugin-nodemailer`
- `@lucidcms/plugin-pages`
- All other packages in `packages/` that are prefixed with `plugin-`

Each MIT-licensed package includes its own `LICENSE` file.
